<h1>Bamazon Products</h1>

<p>Bamazon is a node application that allows a user to purchase products.  The application first lists all of the products available for purchase.  After displaying the products the user can input the ID of the product they are interested in purchasing and how many they would like to purchase.  The application then checks to see if there are enough items in stock to fulfill the user's request.  If there aren't, the application notifies the user with a message.  Otherwise, the application subtracts the amount ordered from the database and calculates the user's total cost.</p>
